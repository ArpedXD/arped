                    <p id="textp1">This was my first field trip ever and it was fun and made alot of memories to me, at first i wasnt actually supposed to join the field trip because i was bored to join and it costed alot but some of my friends actually wanted me to join the field trip to experience the fun of it.since alot of my classmates was gonna join the field trip i decided that i would also join them and luckily i manage to join despite the time and only one of my friends know that i was gonna join so i pranked the others that i wasnt gonna join and when we were on the bus they were confused on why i was there and i just laughed at them.</p>
                <div id="picture2" onclick="pctur2()"></div>
                    <p id="textp2">the whole experience was great we had alot of laughs during the games it just makes me sad that others didnt much participate or play the activities because it feels like they wasted the money they paid for it or it just felt like they just join because of the bonus pts that they will receive from different teachers.this year would probabbly be one of my best years because this was my first time joining the field trip and now im about to join the christmas party after almost a decade of not joining any christmas party on my last few school years.</p>
